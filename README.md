# MarsDataChallenge
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.  
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.


Delierable 1: 

Part one consisted of using Beautiful soup and splinter to access the website and scrape the data. 
I needed to inspect the website to ensure that the right data was being collected. 
The biggest struggle with this is making sure you have the right path for the data you are trying to gather. 

Deliverable 2: 

Part two consisted of the same steps of Part one but with new data and then analyzing the data that was collected. This had similar steps to Part one with the biggest struggle being the same for me, finding the right path. 

Data analysis involved converted the stored data into a Pandas Dataframe and using those tools to solve for the various questions. This was standard but provided a good use of the foundations we built previously when learning Pandas.
